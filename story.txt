Roel modifies the CSV files for repertoires from admin panel
Roel opens app and sees no active gig
Roel presses start gig
App reads in the current CSV file for own+cover repertoire
Roel sees the song list for the current gig all with 0 votes
Audience opens app and sees the song list for the current gig (or no gig if no gig)
Audience can select up to 5 songs they'd like to hear and then press send
Audience can send a song suggestion if the song is not found in the list
Audience can either login with FB or leave their name when requesting a song (now?)
Audience can not request more than 5 songs per gig from a single device/account? (needed?)
Roel gets realtime notifications according to the audience actions
Roel can mark a song as played so it's removed from the list on both sides
Roel can later see a summary of the gigs and song request stats from admin panel

TODO:
- implement admin panel
	- file upload

- deploy on server
- protect admin endpoints

- create API service for mobile app (?)
